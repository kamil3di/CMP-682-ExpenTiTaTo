# CMP 682 Artificial Intelligence Final Project - ExpenTiTaTo
## Hello there!

This repository includes CMP 682 course's final project which have prepared by Kamil Dinleyici and Algı Küçükyavuz. We're glad to complete the codes and the report for this course.

## How to setup and run the game on my computer?

1) First at all you have to clone this repository to your local. Green bar means that you need to write the codes next to it on your terminal.
> git clone https://github.com/kamil3di/CMP-682-ExpenTiTaTo.git

2) Move to this direction.
> cd .\CMP-682-ExpenTiTaTo\

3) We strongly advise you to use virtual enviroment for this project. Let's begin with creating a new virtual enviroment which is named "venv". If you don't want to use virtual enviroment you may skip this part and continue.
> python -m venv venv

> venv\Scripts\activate

4) Get the libraries from PyPi.
> pip install tkinter

> pip install numpy

5) It is time to play game! Run the game.
> python main.py

6) You can play the game on your terminal. Enjoy! 

7) To terminate the code press "CTRL+C" when you are in terminal. If you have selected to run the game using virtual enviroment type "deactivate" at the end and stop using this special virtual enviroment.
